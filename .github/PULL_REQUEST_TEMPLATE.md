    If you are submitting a Vial-enabled keymap for a keyboard in QMK:

    - Keymaps will not be accepted with VIAL_INSECURE=yes.
    - Avoid changing keyboard-level code if possible. (ex: switching the encoder pins in info.json)
    - Please name your keymap "vial". Personal keymaps are not accepted at this time.
      - If your Vial keymap only works for a specific keyboard revision, place it under that revision's folder. (ex: keyboards/planck/rev6_drop/keymaps/vial and keyboards/planck/ez/glow/keymaps/vial)

    If you are submitting a new keyboard with keymaps:

    - If you are also submitting this keyboard to QMK, please try to submit mostly the same code to both repos if possible.
    - If you are not submitting this keyboard to QMK, only include "default" and "vial" keymaps. VIA firmware can no longer be built by this repository.

    ------

    For all keyboard and keymap submissions:

    As the submitter, you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the keyboards/keymaps you submit.
    Vial contributors will try to fix compilation issues as updates are made, but are not always familiar with and often can't test specific keymaps/keyboards.

    Vial is decentralized, so inclusion in the vial-qmk repository is optional. Unmaintained keymaps/keyboards which are broken and cannot be fixed without extensive rework or strong familiarity with the hardware may be removed from this repository, with or without warning.

    For core changes, please explain what you are changing and why.
